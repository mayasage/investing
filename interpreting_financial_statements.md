# Interpreting Financial Statements

## Balance Sheet

- Prepaid expenses will give you an indication as to how the Company runs the business.
- Similarly, changes in  Current Liabilities will also reflect the intentions of the management.

## Non-Current Investments

- It's very difficult to understand their value.

## Intangible Assets

- It's very difficult to ascertain the true value of an intangible asset.

## Fixed Assets

- Don't take the value of Fixed Assets seriously.

## Shareholder's Equity

- Shareholder's Equity = Capital + Surplus
- Don't distinguish between the two.

## Working Capital

- WC (Net Assets) = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- It is extremely important to note that if WC is not adequate, don't look at the Fixed Assets and say that they'll help. They won't.
- If WC is not adequate, and it's not temporary, the business is going down, unless some drastic changes are introduced.
- To find if it's adequate or not, you'll have to compare it to Sales. Then you compare that to other companies in the similar domain, and industry averages.
- Some companies require less working capital (fast-moving goods like chain grocery enterprise), while other require huge working capital (like manufacturing of heavy machinery business).
- Taking loan to finance the W.C is a bad sign. If it's not temporary, the business is going down.
- Seasonal loan is not bad unless it can't be paid off (meaning low demand for the product) or covered by current assets (management knows about the low demand at times, and is prepared, and it's in a normal course of business).


- Net Quick Assets = WC - Inventories
- These must be more than Current Liabilities. It's not good otherwise.
- Use NQA instead of WC.


## Profits

- Some business are cyclic, you need to keep that in mind.

## Inventories

- Inventories needs to be assessed against COGS.
- Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Avg. Inventories

## Trade Receivables

- By looking at them, you can understand the management.
- Too lenient could be a bad sign, as it may mean that people are taking more time to buy the thing, as in low demand.
- The management may make some "adjustments" (meaning gone bad) and show them as footnote.
- Requires strict scrutiny because this deals directly with demand.
- Again, compare across industries.

## Cash in Hand

- These companies generally hold cash in hand in marketable securities, which themselves has a potential for profit or loss. But it's unrelated to business. But it opens a potential for loss of cash in hand if something bad happens in the entire market, affecting multiple companies.
- Cash is King.

## Current Liabilities

- Some Reserves are actually current liabilities. These are values to be offset from Assets (like refund to customers, pending litigation, accidental claims).

## Reserves

- BEWARE. Here's a story.
- 1st year -> sets up a reserve for future depreciation of inventory (decreases earnings this year, even though the event haven't occurred yet)
- 2nd year -> event took place, but absorbed by the reserve (over-stated earning for this year)
- Suppose the company made a $2,000,000 this year, but you don't see the $6,000,000 of reserves in the Balance Sheet. It may be possible that the company actually made a loss of $4,000,000.
- But, it could also be that the $6,000,000 went into the reserves. In that case, the profit is correct.
- The Solution is only one. Follow the trail back to prior years.
- This also means that you can't blindly use the Screener tools available online.
- They won't be able to see through this, and give you the incorrect data.

- People will make up random reserves. Treat them as Surplus.
- Any Reserve that isn't definitely probably, treat it as a part of the Reserves.
- Understand whether changes to Surplus makes some sense. And do they affect earnings ?

## Book Value

- What book value actually means is what the stockholders have put into the business (the cost) plus undistributed profits.
- It doesn't mean that if the business liquidated today, what the shareholders will receive.
- It's an artificial value, since the book value for Fixed & Intangible Assets are artificial too (you won't get that value even if you sell it right away).
- There's some relationship between BV and Average earnings of the business though.
- Large earnings on small Book Value means that the business is good, but it also attracts competition. Could be temporary. But then there's Netflix.
- On the other hand, large BV could be earning small returns at the moment, but they may explode at some point of time later. Imagine pharma stocks.


- Your normal BV per share includes intangibles. Net B.V. doesn't. Again, the screener tool won't know this.

## Liquidating Value

- Net Current Asset / Liquidating Value = W.C. - <must pay liabilities first>
- This is what's left for the shareholders.
- It talks about Current Assets instead of Fixed Assets because in reality, Fixed Assets probably won't sell for much at all.
- It'll only be a small money.
- Current Assets on the other hand, will probably sell close to their value in the books.


- If the stock is selling below this value, it doesn't automatically mean that the stock is under-valued, but it's an important indicator.

## Depreciation

- Some companies use "Retirement Reserve" instead of charging depreciation straight on the SLM method.
- Some companies charge on the SLM method.
- Now Retirement Fund usually deprecates the asset at a much lower speed than the SLM.
- So now if you try to compare companies, you'll get inaccurate results. You'll need to "correct" the accounts.
- Charge SLM on everyone. But then some companies may use the other depreciation method.
- Now, changing this method will have other repercussions on the financial statements.
- Feels like a rabbit hole, but once you do it a few times, you'll get in a habit of doing it. So just hang in there.
- Yet another reason the Screener tool won't work.


- Sometimes they write down Plant & Machinery A/C heavily (event to $1). They're just fooling the stakeholders.
- At other times, they charge heavy depreciation because the base value is "too high" in comparison to the replacement costs.

- The main thing you care about for doing all this is to get the true earnings (as depreciation gets deducted from earnings).
- Remember you're also trying to estimate the value of fixed assets to calculate BV to compare it with the revenue ? They will get affected too. It seems very hard to get the correct value out of this.
- Well try your best, and always compare between companies and industrial average (get from some official source).
- You are on the lookout for 2 things, to not get fooled & get stuck in the smaller things, and to estimate the true earning potential of the company.

## Operating Ratio

- Operating Ratio = Revenue / Operating Expenses (this doesn't include COGS, and are relatively fixed expenses)
- It means that the Revenue can absorb them, tells you about scalability.
- If this ratio is low, it either means that the company has some room to grow, it's the nature of the business, or the company is declining temporarily or permanent. 
- Think about the moat then.

## Fixed Charges

- So my business is generating revenues. But where are they going ? Do I have too much of fixed charges ? If yes, then are they temporary ? Or is it in the nature of the business ?

## Trends

- When there's no boom or depression, the market price is mostly sane.
- However, the markets have a tendency to exaggerate both favourably & unfavourably.
- There are many factors beyond the control of shareholders, management & business. You can't measure these.
- The most you can do is to keep reading the news around your stocks, industries & market conditions.


- The investor who buys the security based on when the price looks cheap according to the accounts, and sells them when they seem high, won't make spectacular profits, but will also avoid spectacular losses. 

# Thoughts

- First you pick some company to evaluate.
- Then you find more companies in the same domain.
- Then you adjust their accounts and find their past year performances, after "cleaning up" their accounts.
    - Earnings per share (EPS)
    - Working Capital Requirements
    - Sales Figures (If they have a division by territory, that's excellent because you then think about why it works in some territories and not in other, and if there's something else that works there. Now what's the moat there ?)
    - Operating Ratio
    - Fixed cost
    - Fixed charges / Gross revenue
    - Bastard Rating (how much do they lie and try to deceive, that's a terrible sign, you can also read their annual reports to compare what they're saying with their accounts. I don't know about you, but I don't want to do business with a bunch of liars).
    - And you try to create a story for each company based on what you understand.
    - After that you create a story of the industry.
    - Then you compare these stories and data with each other.
    - You'll find the need to correct some of your stories. Correct them.
    - Iterate till you are at peace with yourself.
    - At the end of this journey you'll have learned a lot.
- Now you have both the stories and the number for each of these companies.
- You'll select some to be good enough (if you can). It's okay if you can't, move on. It'll come to you some day.
- If you do find some promising stock, then you look at the market price and see if they're selling at a discount.
- Try to buy then even if they're falling to create a tax windfall (this loss can be used to set-off gains later). Actually, scratch that, won't you need a lot more money to buy stocks at a lower value later if you do this ?


- When you think about long-term investing, you don't want to be in a business that can't handle fluctuations.
- What if some disaster strikes tomorrow, will the company crumble ? How soon ?
- Does it have the strength to weather the storm ?

- JUST BE HONEST TO YOURSELF & YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

- Stock picking requires a skillful mental balance between the facts of the past & the possibilities of the future.

- The management must have the ability to meet constantly changing conditions.
