# Interpreting Financial Statements

## Balance Sheet

- Prepaid expenses will give you an indication as to how the Company runs the business.
- Similarly, changes in  Current Liabilities will also reflect the intentions of the management.

## Non-Current Investments

- It's very difficult to understand their value.

## Intangible Assets

- It's very difficult to ascertain the true value of an intangible asset.

## Fixed Assets

- Don't take the value of Fixed Assets seriously.

## Shareholder's Equity

- Shareholder's Equity = Capital + Surplus
- Don't distinguish between the two.

## Working Capital

- WC (Net Assets) = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
- It is extremely important to note that if WC is not adequate, don't look at the Fixed Assets and say that they'll help. They won't.
- If WC is not adequate, and it's not temporary, the business is going down, unless some drastic changes are introduced.
- To find if it's adequate or not, you'll have to compare it to Sales. Then you compare that to other companies in the similar domain, and industry averages.
- Some companies require less working capital (fast-moving goods like chain grocery enterprise), while other require huge working capital (like manufacturing of heavy machinery business).
- Taking loan to finance the W.C is a bad sign. If it's not temporary, the business is going down.
- Seasonal loan is not bad unless it can't be paid off (meaning low demand for the product) or covered by current assets (management knows about the low demand at times, and is prepared, and it's in a normal course of business).


- Net Quick Assets = WC - Inventories
- These must be more than Current Liabilities. It's not good otherwise.
- Use NQA instead of WC.


## Profits

- Some business are cyclic, you need to keep that in mind.

## Inventories

- Inventories needs to be assessed against COGS.
- Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Avg. Inventories

## Trade Receivables

- By looking at them, you can understand the management.
- Too lenient could be a bad sign, as it may mean that people are taking more time to buy the thing, as in low demand.
- The management may make some "adjustments" (meaning gone bad) and show them as footnote.
- Requires strict scrutiny because this deals directly with demand.
- Again, compare across industries.

## Cash in Hand

- These companies generally hold cash in hand in marketable securities, which themselves has a potential for profit or loss. But it's unrelated to business. But it opens a potential for loss of cash in hand if something bad happens in the entire market, affecting multiple companies.
- Cash is King.

## Current Liabilities

- Some Reserves are actually current liabilities. These are values to be offset from Assets (like refund to customers, pending litigation, accidental claims).

## Reserves

- BEWARE. Here's a story.
- 1st year -> sets up a reserve for future depreciation of inventory (decreases earnings this year, even though the event haven't occurred yet)
- 2nd year -> event took place, but absorbed by the reserve (over-stated earning for this year)
- Suppose the company made a $2,000,000 this year, but you don't see the $6,000,000 of reserves in the Balance Sheet. It may be possible that the company actually made a loss of $4,000,000.
- But, it could also be that the $6,000,000 went into the reserves. In that case, the profit is correct.
- The Solution is only one. Follow the trail back to prior years.
- This also means that you can't blindly use the Screener tools available online.
- They won't be able to see through this, and give you the incorrect data.

- People will make up random reserves. Treat them as Surplus.
- Any Reserve that isn't definitely probably, treat it as a part of the Reserves.
- Understand whether changes to Surplus makes some sense. And do they affect earnings ?

## Book Value

- What book value actually means is what the stockholders have put into the business (the cost) plus undistributed profits.
- It doesn't mean that if the business liquidated today, what the shareholders will receive.
- It's an artificial value, since the book value for Fixed & Intangible Assets are artificial too (you won't get that value even if you sell it right away).
- There's some relationship between BV and Average earnings of the business though.
- Large earnings on small Book Value means that the business is good, but it also attracts competition. Could be temporary. But then there's Netflix.
- On the other hand, large BV could be earning small returns at the moment, but they may explode at some point of time later. Imagine pharma stocks.


- Your normal BV per share includes intangibles. Net B.V. doesn't. Again, the screener tool won't know this.

## Liquidating Value

- Net Current Asset / Liquidating Value = W.C. - <must pay liabilities first>
- This is what's left for the shareholders.
- It talks about Current Assets instead of Fixed Assets because in reality, Fixed Assets probably won't sell for much at all.
- It'll only be a small money.
- Current Assets on the other hand, will probably sell close to their value in the books.


- If the stock is selling below this value, it doesn't automatically mean that the stock is under-valued, but it's an important indicator.

## Depreciation

- Some companies use "Retirement Reserve" instead of charging depreciation straight on the SLM method.
- Some companies charge on the SLM method.
- Now Retirement Fund usually deprecates the asset at a much lower speed than the SLM.
- So now if you try to compare companies, you'll get inaccurate results. You'll need to "correct" the accounts.
- Charge SLM on everyone. But then some companies may use the other depreciation method.
- Now, changing this method will have other repercussions on the financial statements.
- Feels like a rabbit hole, but once you do it a few times, you'll get in a habit of doing it. So just hang in there.
- Yet another reason the Screener tool won't work.


- Sometimes they write down Plant & Machinery A/C heavily (event to $1). They're just fooling the stakeholders.
- At other times, they charge heavy depreciation because the base value is "too high" in comparison to the replacement costs.

- The main thing you care about for doing all this is to get the true earnings (as depreciation gets deducted from earnings).
- Remember you're also trying to estimate the value of fixed assets to calculate BV to compare it with the revenue ? They will get affected too. It seems very hard to get the correct value out of this.
- Well try your best, and always compare between companies and industrial average (get from some official source).
- You are on the lookout for 2 things, to not get fooled & get stuck in the smaller things, and to estimate the true earning potential of the company.

## Operating Ratio

- Operating Ratio = Revenue / Operating Expenses (this doesn't include COGS, and are relatively fixed expenses)
- It means that the Revenue can absorb them, tells you about scalability.
- If this ratio is low, it either means that the company has some room to grow, it's the nature of the business, or the company is declining temporarily or permanent. 
- Think about the moat then.

## Fixed Charges

- So my business is generating revenues. But where are they going ? Do I have too much of fixed charges ? If yes, then are they temporary ? Or is it in the nature of the business ?

## Trends

- When there's no boom or depression, the market price is mostly sane.
- However, the markets have a tendency to exaggerate both favourably & unfavourably.
- There are many factors beyond the control of shareholders, management & business. You can't measure these.
- The most you can do is to keep reading the news around your stocks, industries & market conditions.


- The investor who buys the security based on when the price looks cheap according to the accounts, and sells them when they seem high, won't make spectacular profits, but will also avoid spectacular losses. 

## Ratios

- Margin of Profit = Operating Income / Revenue
- Earnings on Invested Capital = Total Income (Operating Income + Non-operating Income) / Sum of money invested
  - The people put in this much money and got this much income. 
- Times Interest Charges Earned = Total Income / Interest Paid
  - How much year of interests can the earnings cover ? If the management is good, they won't have much problem in the bad years. 
- Times Interest Charges and Preferred Dividend Earned = Total Income / (Interest + Preferred Dividend)
  - If you're doing a straight investment, you need this ratio to be high, as it would mean better hope for return (of course the business needs to be good too in the upcoming years). 
- Earning Per Share on Common Stock = Income available for common stocks / No. of shares outstanding
  - This is the return per share of the business. Whether they give dividend or re-invest into the business is upto them.
- Net Income Transferred to Surplus as a Percentage of Net Income Available for Dividends = Amount transferred to Surplus / Income Before Dividends (yes, even before giving out preferred dividends)
  - This will tell you how conservative the company is regarding dividend policy. Again, you'll have to compare across companies & over the years.
- Inventory Turnover Ratio (ITR) = COGS / Inventory
  - Use Sales if you can't find COGS.
  - A high ITR means:
    - A good demand for the products, that's why the inventory is getting used. Or not. What if the company keeps producing, but it's not selling.
    - You need less capital investment in inventories, which means less working capital is required.
    - Low risk of obsolescence of Inventory.
- Number of Days Average Account Receivable is Outstanding = Account Receivable (per year) / Revenue per day (Revenue / 365)
- Capitalization Ratios
  - How much is the company financed from different sources ?
  - Bond Capitalization = Outstanding Bonds / Sum of all financial instruments (bonds + preferred + common stock) & surplus
    - How much is the company financed through bonds.
  - Preferred Stock Capitalization = Preferred Stock / (Sum of all financial instruments + surplus) 
  - Common Stock and Surplus Capitalization = (Common Stock + Surplus) / (Sum of all financial instruments + surplus)
    - more than 50% must be from common stock & surplus.
- Stock value ratio for Preferred Stock = Total Market Value of Common Stock / (par/book value of bonds + market value of preferred stock) 
  - The proportion of common stock financing to other financing.
- Stock value ratio for Bonds = (Market Value of Preferred Stocks + Market Value of Common Stocks) / Par value of Bonds
  - These ratios may make more sense than B.V. since they use the actual value of the instrument in the market.
- Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
  - A current ratio of 5.04 will imply that the company has $5.04 in current assets for each $ in current liabilities. This ratio of course varies by industries, so find it and compare.  
- Quick Assets Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
- Book Value of Common Stock = (Common Stock + Surplus) / No. of shares of common stock outstanding
  - You must exclude intangible assets from the book value.
  - Book value is largely useless. The only time it's worth thinking about is when the difference between this and the market price is large.
- Price-Earning Ratio / Market Ratio = Market Price Per Share / Earning Per Share
  - How high or low is the share selling for ?

# Thoughts

- First you pick some company to evaluate.
- Then you find more companies in the same domain.
- Then you adjust their accounts and find their past year performances, after "cleaning up" their accounts.
    - Earnings per share (EPS)
    - Working Capital Requirements
    - Sales Figures (If they have a division by territory, that's excellent because you then think about why it works in some territories and not in other, and if there's something else that works there. Now what's the moat there ?)
    - Operating Ratio
    - Fixed cost
    - Fixed charges / Gross revenue
    - Bastard Rating (how much do they lie and try to deceive, that's a terrible sign, you can also read their annual reports to compare what they're saying with their accounts. I don't know about you, but I don't want to do business with a bunch of liars).
    - And you try to create a story for each company based on what you understand.
    - After that you create a story of the industry.
    - Then you compare these stories and data with each other.
    - You'll find the need to correct some of your stories. Correct them.
    - Iterate till you are at peace with yourself.
    - At the end of this journey you'll have learned a lot.
- Now you have both the stories and the number for each of these companies.
- You'll select some to be good enough (if you can). It's okay if you can't, move on. It'll come to you some day.
- If you do find some promising stock, then you look at the market price and see if they're selling at a discount.
- Try to buy then even if they're falling to create a tax windfall (this loss can be used to set-off gains later). Actually, scratch that, won't you need a lot more money to buy stocks at a lower value later if you do this ?


- When you think about long-term investing, you don't want to be in a business that can't handle fluctuations.
- What if some disaster strikes tomorrow, will the company crumble ? How soon ?
- Does it have the strength to weather the storm ?

- JUST BE HONEST TO YOURSELF & YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY.

- Stock picking requires a skillful mental balance between the facts of the past & the possibilities of the future.

- The management must have the ability to meet constantly changing conditions.

## Financial Terms & Phrases

- Acceleration Clause: If you fail interest payments on bond (or some other "event of default" occurs), then it may be declared that you must pay back the bond principal in advance, because they're becoming afraid and losing trust in you.
- Accruals: Expenses charged, but cash payment not yet made. Example: bond interest is accrued each month, but is usually paid at six-month intervals. On the other hand, interest on securities held is also an accrual.
- Accumulative (Dividends) = Cumulative Dividends
- Adjustment Bonds = Income Bonds
- "After acquired property": I am a Debtor. I have signed on a clause that says "all my property secures my debt". Now, suppose I buy a new property or upgrade the existing, then that too is part of the Debt, because you signed on the "all" timeless, unconditional clause). Imagine you went into Debt to buy a home, then you made improvements to it, and ended up getting filed for bankruptcy. Now your creditors will enjoy those improvements.
- Amortization: Gradually extinguishing a liability, deferred charge, or capital expenditure over a period of time.
- Arbitrage: Simultaneous buy and sell for profit. Example: buying in the London stock exchange, and selling it in New York Stock Exchange. Or sell a stock and buy it back via "rights", bonds or preferred stock that are convertible back to common stock at a definite ratio.
- Articles of Association. A document similar to a certificate of incorporation setting forth the terms under which an enterprise is authorized by a state to do business.
- Asset Value = Book Value
- Bankers' Shares / Trustee Shares: A trustee holds ownership of shares on behalf of beneficiaries, following bank regulations. Why ? Tax minimization and long-term planning among other reasons. (Imagine a rich family holding their money in such trustee shares.)
- Coupon / Nominal Yield / Coupon Rate/ Coupon Percentage Rate: Interest rate on a bond. Usually paid semi-annually.
  - Coupon Rate = Sum of Coupon Payments in a year / Bond's face value
  - So, bonds not yet matured are traded in the market. Therefore, we have another concept.
  - Current Yield = Annual Interest / Current Price
  - This is what you'll earn from the bond by buying & holding it for 1 year (according to the current market).
  - Now it may seem to you that the bond is a good investment, but beware.
  - Suppose you buy a bond for $100, and after 2 years it's price becomes $75, then you sell it. Now you lost $5. Even though you made $10 each both the years, you still made a loss because the market value of the bond went down. However, if you buy and hold till maturity, and never sell then you'll definitely be in profit, unless something drastic happens like company bankruptcy & still couldn't pay back even the bonds somehow (you should not be in this position, that's why we're doing security analysis after all) or heavy inflation (so much that the bond returns are negligible, I don't understand what's going to happen then).
  - This doesn't seem a wholesome indicator now. So, here's the wholesome one.
  - Yield to Maturity = The anticipated return if she holds the bond until it matures in Present Value
  - You need 4 things to calculate this: Market Price, Par Value, Coupon Interest Rate, Time to Maturity.
  - You also need to add the coupon's return as re-investment in the same instrument, in the same manner, which you probably won't even be able to do in real life. I mean how is it possible that I can reinvest in the same excellent instrument every six-month with the interest and it remains just as excellent ? If it's excellent, other people will buy on it, and make it less than excellent.
  - I'll leave this to Security Analysis.
  - So, coupon rate and current yield are different.
- Basis/Yield Basis: Quoting the price of a fixed-income security as a yield percentage, instead of a dollar value. Bonds have varying characteristics. So you're trying to compare bonds by their earning potential.
  - Yield basis = Coupon amount paid annually / bond purchase price
  - If yield basis > coupon rate, this means that the bond is selling at a discount. On the other hand, if yield price < coupon rate, the bond is selling at a premium.
- Blue Chip Issues: High price to earning ratio, popular market leaders.
- "Blue Sky" Flotations: You get blue sky for your money. These securities have no value. Banned. Imagine someone selling people securities without giving them any information about them, except promises of big return.
- Bonds Vs Notes: Notes are short-termed (<5 years), while Bonds are long-termed.
- Bond Discount: My company issued a bond. The amount I received was less than par (face value). This discount is a loss & is amortized over the life of the bond.
- Straight Bond / Bonds, Straight: Has the following 3:
  - unqualified right to repayment of a fixed principal amount on a fixed date
  - unqualified right to fixed interest payment on fixed dates
  - no further interest in assets or profits
  - no voice in management
- It's a vanilla bond. Like U.S. Treasury bonds.
- Bonds, Underlying: These bonds have precedence over some other bond or bonds. Usually hold a first mortgage on property of the corporation.
- Break-Up Value / Sum-of-parts value: I have a business. The business has multiple segments (child companies you may assume or maybe my company is an Investment Trust). Break-up value will be the sum of the worth of each of these child businesses. You calculate everything at market price.
- Callable Features: A company can retire a bond or preferred stock in advance of maturity.
- Capitalization: Sum of bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks.
- Capital Structure: Division of capital between bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks. If common stocks represents most of the capital structure, the structure is called "conservative". Where common stocks represents a small percentage of the total, the structure is called "speculative".
- Capitalizing Fixed Charges: I can afford an annual payment of $100,000. I know that 4% is the lowest rate I can push to. Then what would be the principal amount ? $100,000 / 4% = $25,00,000. So you'll issue $25,00,000 @ 4% p.a.
- Cash Asset Value: Amount of cash receivable from securities after deducting all liabilities. Stated as per share or per $1000 bond. It can also be stated without deducting prior liabilities, which makes sense when your other assets cover all the liabilities.
- Cash Equivalents: Assets that are held in place of cash, and are convertible to cash in a very short time. Example: Time deposits, U.S. Government bonds and other marketable securities.
- Certified Report: A corporate report (Balance Sheet, Income Statement and/or Surplus Statement) attested by a certified public accountant. You need to look at the certificate of the auditor because audits vary by scope.
- Charter: The certificate of incorporation or franchise that grants legal powers to the business written in the charter.
- Civil Loans: Loans taken by any government agency.
- Class "A" Stock: To distinguish it from other shares like class "B".
- Collateral-Trust Bonds: Bonds secured by other securities (either stocks or bonds) deposited with a trustee.
- Consolidation = Merger
- Contingent Liabilities: Liabilities indefinite as to either their amount or their occurrence. Examples: amounts involved in lawsuits or tax claims; liabilities under a guarantee.
- Conversion Parity or Conversion Level: At what rate is the common stock convertible to a preferred stock. If preferred stock sells at 90, and you can get 3 shares of common stocks for 1 share of preferred stock, then conversion parity is 30 (90 / 3). This is not money, but the rate of conversion.
- Conversion Price: At what price is the common stock convertible into bond or preferred stock. I have $1000 bond convertible to 40 shares of common stock, the conversion price is $1000 / 40 = $25 per share. This is the actual money.
- Conversion Privilege = Convertible Issues.
- Cumulative Preferred Stock: Preferred stock that must be paid dividends at a fixed rate, and if you couldn't pay dividends in the previous years, you'll need to pay them subsequently before common stocks get anything.
- Cumulative Voting: Allow shareholders to vote proportionately to the number of shares they hold. So a shareholders with 100 shares can cast the equivalent of 100 votes instead of the typical 1 vote per shareholder. Allow shareholders to split votes.
- Current Asset Value (per share) = Current Asset - Total Liabilities equivalent to a given security. Preferred stock are also Liabilities. Note that we're subtracting all the liabilities and not just the current, so this is not the working capital. Fixed Assets are ignored because they have no market value and in a good business current assets need to overwhelm liabilities.
- Debentures: Debt without collateral. Unsecured bonds.
- Deed of Trust = Indenture.
- Dilution: Increase in the number of common shares without a corresponding increase in the company's assets. Most convertible are protected from this by increasing the conversion price. It's called an "anti-dilution clause".
- Dividend Coverage: The number of times a dividend is earned in a given period.
- Dividend Yield: Annual Dividend per share / Market Price per share.
- Scrip: A script is a substitute to legal tender. Holding it entitles the bearer to receive something in return. These have been used to compensate employees when money was in short supply. Example: gift cards, reward points and coupons.
- Divisional Liens: A lien is a claim on the property of a Debtor. Divisional lien is secured by a section of minor length of a railroad system. If the mileage covered by the lien is a valuable part of the system, the specific security is good.
- Earning Power: A reasonably probable rate of earning of a particular security of company.
- Earning Yield = Annual stock earning per share / Market price per share.
- Effective Debt: The actual debt obligations. It includes fixed charges.
- Rolling stock: Vehicles used in transit & support services.
- Equipment Rentals: Sum paid by one railroad to another for the use of rolling stock.The payments are on a per-day basis (diem).
- Equipment Trust: Trustee owns the rolling stock & issue equipment trust certificates or bonds.
- Trading on the Equity: When a businessman borrow money to supplement his equity. Sometimes used to mean the extreme case of significant more debt than capital.
- Factor of Safety: Earnings after deducting interest / Interest. How much can earning after paying this year's interest ? The business is doing that good.
- Flush production: When you find a new oil well, the first period of its life will generate a lot of oil. This is temporary & lasts only a short period of time. Later, you'll get a "settled production", which is a much lower production.
- Foreclosure: Enforce payment by snatching the mortgage of the debt.
- Going Concern Value: Estimating the value of an enterprise based on its earning power rather than liquidation value.
- Gold Clause: All bonds issued before 1933 promised payment in gold dollars of the same weight and finesse as when the debt was contracted. Illegal now.
- Hedge: Fix future delivery of commodities right now to avoid effects of price changes (for commodity market). Or protection against losses by putting some money in the opposite direction.
- Holding Company = Parent Company.
- House of Issue: Investment banking company that underwrites and distributes security issues.
- Underwriting: An individual or institution that takes on financial risk for a fee. When a company wants to sell its shares, they'll go to the underwriter, and sell all the shares to it. Then the underwriter will sell the shares in the open market. The risk is that the security may sell below the target price. The underwriter will bear this loss.
- Income Bonds / Adjustment Bonds: The payment of interest depends on earnings. Sometimes a part of interest is fixed.
- Indenture / Deed of Trust: Terms & conditions document of bond.
- Investment Trust: An enterprise that invests for its bond and stockholders.
- Joint and Several Guarantee: Guarantor will be liable if associates fail.
- Joint Facility Rents: The trains of railroads expires and have to be dealt with. So many railroads pay rent for "terminal facilities". It can be any facility regarding railroads.
- Junior issue: Issue doesn't have superior claim on interest or dividend or principal value. It comes after some other issue called senior issue. Example: secondary mortgage is a junior issue, primary mortgage is senior; common stock is junior, preferred stock is senior.
- Leasehold: The right to occupy a property for a specified period of time at a specified rental.
- Leasehold Obligations: Liability to pay rental on leasehold for a specified period of time.
- Legal Investments: The banking department of state publishes annually a list of securities considered eligible for investment by saving banks and trust funds, called "legals".
- Leverage: The condition that effects earnings due to relatively heavy fixed costs or deductions.
- Margin Of Profit = Operating Income / Sales. Depreciation is included, taxes are excluded. Interest charges are also excluded.
- Margin Of Safety: How much can the earnings drop before the company defaults on its interest payments. Interest Coverage = the earnings of the company is how much higher than its interest, (Annual Earnings before interest & taxes / Interest payments per year). Margin of Safety = Earnings Left / Total Earnings = (Interest Coverage - 1) / Interest Coverage = Earnings after interest / Earnings before interest. What portion is earnings after interest of the total earnings ? This entire portion can become zero & the company will still be able to pay interest. If Margin of Safety is 42 6/7 %, then the earnings of that company can fall by this much before it defaults on its interest obligations.
- Minority Interest: Appears in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company and reflects the portion not owner by it. In the Income Statement, it's deducted from Net Income as "Minority Interest" or "Non-controlling Interest" as the subsidiary's earnings that belongs to the minority shareholders. In the balance sheet, appears under the equity section as "Minority Interests" or "Non Controlling Interests" representing the minority shareholders' share in subsidiary's net assets.
- Mortgage, "Blanket": One mortgage covers two or more properties. Individual pieces can be sold without returning the entire mortgage.
- Lien: Legal right of creditors against Debtor's property if it fails to fulfill its contract.
- Mortgage, General: Lien against all the fixed property of a corporation at the time of issuance.
- Co-op Housing: A company will own the houses. You'll buy shares equivalent to a house, and have to pay maintenance fees. You have no right to modify or sell the house, the property gain won't be yours, its company's. You, however, can sell your shares (but you, not owning your own home and doing whatever with it is a huge caveat generally, you pay for something and still don't own it).
- Mortgage, Guaranteed: by a Mortgage Guarantee Company or a Surety Company.
- Negotiable Instruments: IOU. Example: currency, checks, promissory notes, acceptances, coupon bonds. They can be passed around. Stocks are non-negotiable though. They are always registered with a stockholder. They are always attached with a name of who owns them, unlike negotiable instruments.
- Promissory Notes: Written promises by one party to pay another party a fixed amount, either on demand or at a future date. It has the signature of the issuer, or the promisor, to pay a certain amount, but not of the promisee or payee (the one who'll receive it), thus, making it negotiable. Indian Law System have a hard cap on the amount & validity of a promissory note. 3 years. I have downloaded a book on Negotiable Instruments Act. You read it when you have time. When you loan someone money enter into a formal agreement, and ask for a signed cheque without date. Don't mention the cheque number in the agreement, or else if you lose the cheque, then you lost the number written on the agreement, and won't be able to do anything. Note that the cheque has a 3 months validity only. If cheques get blocked, then the person will go under 138 NZ Act. There is another convention that governs the international trade regarding promissory notes, called 1930 Geneva Convention of Uniform Law on Bills Of Exchange and Promissory Notes. Have download some data on it. Just give it a look when you have some time. The appeal of promissory notes is that it's a simple instrument that is easy & cheap to create, but is also legally enforceable. Universities make students sign a 10-year-long recurrent promissory note for student loans.
- Acceptance: Similar to promissory notes but for importing of goods. It deals with international trade, so it's created different from a seemingly more generic promissory note.

## Analysis Attempts

### General Motors

Lesson: This is why companies only care about efficiency.

- General Motors (GM) had become bloated.
- The competitors had cheaper cars with better mileage due to cost-cutting and better research & development.
- The fuel prices were increasing, so people started dropping GM.
- GM filed for bankruptcy.
- Government poured billions of dollars into GM to create a new GM. The old company remained "General Motors Corporations", and the new company came be known as "General Motors Company".
- The new company was leaner, clean & profitable, and the old one was bankrupt.
- The creditors of the old company received shares in the new company.
- Workers in the old company lost their jobs, the shareholders lost all their wealth because no one would buy a dead company's share.
